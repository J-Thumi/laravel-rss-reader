# 🌐 OmniFeed

In today’s fast-paced world, staying ahead of the news is more important than ever.  
Every day, something changes — new technologies emerge, global events unfold, and industries evolve rapidly.  

The problem?  
There are countless news websites, each with valuable information, but constantly switching between them can be **time-consuming and overwhelming**. Important updates can easily slip through the cracks.  

What if there was a single platform where you could log in and instantly access curated teasers, descriptions, and direct links to the latest articles from multiple trusted sources?  

That’s where **OmniFeed** comes in. 🚀
